# Introduction

I recently bought a [Kemper Profiler](https://www.kemper-amps.com/profiler/overview)

## FBV Express™ MkII

The FBV Express™ MkII uses a RJ45 connector for communication and
power. The communication interface is full-duplex RS485 and the device can
be powered from +8VDC to +9VDC, in my hardware project I chose to use
+9VDC as +9VDC power supplies are easy to come by. The signals on the RJ45
connector can be easily accessed using SparkFun's RJ45 Breakout and 8-Pin
Connector. However, you should keep in mind that the square pin of the
SparkFun RJ45 8-Pin Connector is pin number 8 and not 1. The correct pin
numbering of the SparkFun RJ45 8-Pin Connector is given in the following
image:

### RJ45 Pinout

The pinout of the RJ45 connector from the host side is as follows:


| Pin Number    | Function   |
| ------------- |:----------:|
| 1             | RS485 TX+  |
| 2             | +9VDC      |
| 3             | RS485 RX+  |
| 4             | GND        |
| 5             | +9VDC      |
| 6             | GND        |
| 7             | RS485 RX-  |
| 8             | RS485 TX-  |

### RS485 to TTL Conversion

In order to use one MCU 3.3V UART to communicate with the floor controller
we need an RS485 converter. The following table shows the correct
connection:

| ----------------------------- |:---------------------:|
| 1                             | Y                     |
| 3                             | A                     |
| 7                             | B                     |
| 8                             | Z                     |
